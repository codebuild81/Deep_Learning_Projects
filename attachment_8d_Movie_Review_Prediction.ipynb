The person concerned will get a new kitchen or perhaps bedroom and bathroom and is wonderfully grateful for what they have got. The US version of this show is everything that reality TV shouldn\\'t be. Instead of making a few improvements to a house which the occupants could not afford or do themselves the entire house gets rebuilt. I do not know if this show is trying to show what a lousy welfare system exists in the US or if you beg hard enough you will receive. The rather vulgar product placement that takes place, particularly by Sears, is also uncalled for. Rsther than turning one family in a deprived area into potential millionaires, it would be far better to help the community as a whole where instead of spending the hundreds of thousands of dollars on one home, build something for the whole community ..... perhaps a place where diy and power tools can be borrowed and returned along with building materials so that everyone can benefit should they want to. Giving it all to one person can cause enormous resentment among the rest of the local community who still live in the same run down houses.']"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"fXgBAlGkyGjY","colab_type":"code","colab":{"autoexec":{"startup":false,"wait_interval":0}}},"cell_type":"code","source":["#Convert text data to numbers using tokenizer\n","data_num = t.texts_to_matrix(data, mode='tfidf')\n","print(len(data_num[0]))"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"N0Y-dcpDyZhg","colab_type":"code","colab":{"autoexec":{"startup":false,"wait_interval":0}}},"cell_type":"code","source":["#Predict probability on numbers\n","prediction = model.predict(data_num)\n","\n","print(prediction[0])"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"R-NVf-TvyszX","colab_type":"code","colab":{"autoexec":{"startup":false,"wait_interval":0}}},"cell_type":"code","source":["!wget https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00455/EmptyFile.docx"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"qRBZXoeVzYgx","colab_type":"code","colab":{"autoexec":{"startup":false,"wait_interval":0}}},"cell_type":"code","source":["!ls"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"s7ky9rh6y0mr","colab_type":"text"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["is it Positive or Negative?"]}]}
